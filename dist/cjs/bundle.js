If not, Qadaa (makeup) is not required.\n\n## Additional Clarifications\n\n- Since your Hayd ended earlier than usual; there is always a chance that your Hayd could still return. A precautionary Ghusl at your Hayd habit time is advisable due to the possibility of bleeding resuming within 15 days (from the conclusion of Hayd).\n- Such resuming of bleeding may end up compromising your Salaah (prayer) until you have repeated your Ghusl again. The precautionary Ghusl is therefore adviced to avoid this from happening.\n\n## Ramadan Clarifications\n\n- If your Hayd ended during the day, then you are required to behave like a fasting person for the remainder of the day by abstaining from food, drinks and conjugal relationships.\n- If your Hayd ended during the night, such that there was enough time before Fajr for you to complete a Ghusl (full ablution) and Takbeer-e-Tahreema, then accordingly you will be required to fast that day. If no such time sufficient was remaining, then you will be considered as someone whose Hayd ended during the day and accordingly you will be required to behave like a fasting person and later on make Qadaa (makeup) of that day.\n\n## Marital Clarifications\n\n- Conjugal relationships are not yet allowed, until the Hayd habit has been reached\n- Until such time, specific physical boundaries are set for the husband:\n  - Direct contact with or viewing the wife's skin between the navel and knee is strictly prohibited.\n  - Engaging in any sexual activity that stimulates the wife's vagina is forbidden, including conjugal relations and other forms of stimulation, such as masturbation.\n- However, within these limits, the husband may:\n  - Rest his head on the wife's clothed lap.\n  - Kiss any other part of the wife's body, including mouth-to-mouth kissing.\n  - Engage in physical contact like fondling breasts.\n  - Have non-penetrative physical contact with any of his body parts while ensuring no vaginal stimulation occurs.\n- Husband and wife will continue to interact with each other in day-to-day matters such as eating together, sleeping in the same bed etc.\n- Conjugal relationships will remain impermissible even if the bleeding has fully stopped. (because this is still the time before the Hayd habit.)\n- Divorce during this time is impermissible, but if issued, it will be valid and carry its full implications.\n- Once the Hayd habit has been reached and the bleeding has not returned, then conjugal relationships are allowed again.\n","11_ruling_most_likely_tuhr_concluding_ongoing_hayd_before_10_days.md":"# Ruling: Most Likely Tuhr\n\n- Based on the latest information provided by you, your Ongoing Hayd concluded after your latest Hayd habit and did not exceed 10 days.\n- Accordingly, on it's conclusion you were to perform a Ghusl (full ablution) to attain purity from the state of Hayd and resume your seasonal/daily worship as applies (Prayer and Ramadan etc.)\n- If the conclusion of Hayd was just before a Salaah (prayer) time while there was sufficient time for Ghusl (full ablution) and Takbeer-e-Tahreema remaining, perform Qadaa (makeup) for the missed Salaah (prayer). If not, Qadaa (makeup) is not required.\n- Until a Tuhr of 15 days since the conclusion of your Hayd has not occurred, the ruling could slightly change, ensure to keep track of this.\n\n## Ramadan Clarifications\n\n- If your Hayd ended during the day, then you are required to behave like a fasting person for the remainder of the day by abstaining from food, drinks and conjugal relationships.\n- If your Hayd ended during the night, such that there was enough time before Fajr for you to complete a Ghusl (full ablution) and Takbeer-e-Tahreema, then accordingly you will be required to fast that day. If no such time sufficient was remaining, then you will be considered as someone whose Hayd ended during the day and accordingly you will be required to behave like a fasting person and later on make Qadaa (makeup) of that day.\n\n## Marital Clarifications\n\n- As long bleeding has not returned at any point in time, then conjugal relationships are allowed again.\n","12_ruling_tuhr_concluding_ongoing_bleeding_exceeding_10_days.md":"# Ruling: Tuhr\n\n## Guidance\n\n- Your Hayd lasted till your latest Hayd habit:\n  - In the case you took a precautionary Ghusl (full ablution) at the conclusion of your Hayd habit, as advised previously, then none of the worhsip you performed since then has been compromised.\n  - If not, then each Salaah (prayer) since your Hayd habit will be invalidated until a time where you did Ghusl (full ablution)\n- Any Qadaa (makeup) Salaah (prayer) performed until your Hayd habit will be invalid and will need to be repeated.\n- Any Salaah (prayer) that was not performed between Hayd habit day and the 10th day of your Ongoing Bleeding will need to be made Qadaa (makeup) of\n\n## Additional Clarifications\n\n- Matters have consolidated as your Ongoing Bleeding exceeded 10 days\n- The meaning of Hayd habit is the latest valid duration of Hayd as recorded, that we revert to in this case.\n- Accordingly, your habit was applied and the previous guidance you received has changed accordingly.\n- Kindly consult a scholar about the precautionary Ghusl (full ablution) if this is a source of confusion to you.\n\n## Ramadan Clarifications\n\n- On account of reverting back to your latest habit:\n  - Any Qadaa (makeup) fasting performed until your Hayd habit will be invalid and will need to be repeated.\n  - Any fasting that was not performed between Hayd habit day and the 10th day of your Ongoing Bleeding will need to be made Qadaa (makeup) of\n\n## Marital Clarifications\n\n- Conjugal relationships are permissible\n","13_ruling_istihaadah.md":"# Ruling: Istihadah\n\n- When a bleeding is observed outside the days of Hayd/Nifaas, then such a bleeding is termed Istihaadah\n- From a religious perspective, this bleeding is to be regarded on the same level as a nose bleeding:\n  - Despite this bleeding, you are still required to observe your daily prayers and fasting\n  - If this bleeding is continuous, then you are to wait with praying until the bleeding subsides.\n    - However, if the time of Salaah is about to expire, then one should do a Wudu and pray as normal.\n  - If the bleeding continuous such that it encompasses an entire Salaah time, from beginning till the end such that in between there is not sufficient time to do Wudu and complete a prayer, then the ruling of an Excused Person (Ma’dhur) will apply to you, which you can read in more detail here: ...\n\n## Additional Clarifications\n\n- This type of bleeding can be deceiving, where physically speaking the flow can be very heavy and have all the signs of Hayd/Nifaas.

Seek guidance from scholars for advice tailored to your individual case.\n  2.

Practice based on this assumption.\n- If future information reclassifies the bleeding as Istihaadah, you'll be obligated (Waajib) to makeup for missed worship.\n- However, there's no sin in missing worship when acting on the best available evidence.\n\n## Ramadan Clarifications\n\n- If bleeding begins during daytime fasting, it's Waajib (mandatory/necessary) to break your fast discreetly and do Qadaa (makeup) for it later.\n- Bleeding that starts and persists overnight until Fajr exempts you from fasting that day, but you must do Qadaa (makeup) for it subsequently.\n- Should bleeding stop during the day, continue to observe fast-like behavior (abstaining from food, drink, and conjugal relations), though making up the fast later is still required.\n- If bleeding ceases at night, leaving enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreema before Fajr, fast the oncoming day.
