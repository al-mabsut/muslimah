(because this is still the time before the Hayd habit.)\n- Divorce during this time is impermissible, but if issued, it will be valid and carry its full implications.\n- Once the Hayd habit has been reached and the bleeding has not returned, then conjugal relationships are allowed again.\n","11_ruling_most_likely_tuhr_concluding_ongoing_hayd_before_10_days.md":"# Ruling: Most Likely Tuhr\n\n- Based on the latest information provided by you, your Ongoing Hayd concluded after your latest Hayd habit and did not exceed 10 days.\n- Accordingly, on it's conclusion you were to perform a Ghusl (full ablution) to attain purity from the state of Hayd and resume your seasonal/daily worship as applies (Prayer and Ramadan etc.)\n- If the conclusion of Hayd was just before a Salaah (prayer) time while there was sufficient time for Ghusl (full ablution) and Takbeer-e-Tahreema remaining, perform Qadaa (makeup) for the missed Salaah (prayer).
