# Ruling: Bleeding Most Likely Hayd

## Guidance

- Your latest recorded discharges may soon qualify as Hayd, although they haven't yet surpassed the 72-hour threshold.
- Everytime the bleeding discontinues such that you are not sure if it will come back later or if it has completely stopped, it's Wajib to complete your Salaah at the latest permissible times:
  - For Fajr and Dhuhr: Pray at the last possible moment.
  - For ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Isha: Pray before Makrooh time, defined as:
    - ‘Asr: About 20 minutes before sunset when the sun turns pale yellow.
    - Maghrib: When many stars are visible, but with Western horizon still red.
    - ‘Isha: At the midpoint between Maghrib and Fajr.
- Once the minimum quota for Hayd has been met, then all the Ahkaam related to Hayd will apply. Ensure to make a proper record once your bleeding has exceeded 72 hours.
- If bleeding stops for more than 15 days, and is shorter than 3 days, it's considered Istihadah, requiring Qadaa of missed Salaah during these days you were advised not to pray by us.

## Additional Clarifications

- Delaying Salaah is advised due to the potential recurrence of bleeding, making it Wajib to adhere to this guidance.
- You are not yet required to do Ghusl each time your bleeding stops. You may suffice on Wudu for each Salaah
- If bleeding resumes and meets the Hayd criterion of at least bridging 72 hours(spotting or otherwise), actions taken during this period may need review:
  - Repeat any Qadaa Salaah and fasting performed during this time (when possible to do so).
  - Remake any Ramadan fasting observed during this period.
  - Fard Salaah performed, though nullified, won't require repetition.
- Despite the possibility of bleeding not lasting over 72 hours, current evidence suggests it's likely to become Hayd. Practice based on this assumption.
- If future information reclassifies the bleeding as Istihadah, you'll be Wajib to makeup for missed worship.
- However, there's no sin in missing worship when acting on the best available evidence.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- If bleeding begins during daytime fasting, it's Wajib to break your fast discreetly and do Qadaa for it later.
- Bleeding that starts and persists overnight until Fajr exempts you from fasting that day, but you must do Qadaa for it subsequently.
- Should bleeding stop during the day, continue to observe fast-like behavior (abstaining from food, drink, and conjugal relations), though making up the fast later is still required.
- If bleeding ceases at night, leaving enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreema before Fajr, fast the oncoming day. If not, behave as fasting but do Qadaa for it later.

## Marital Clarifications

- During this period, specific physical boundaries are set for the husband:
  - Direct contact with or viewing the wife's skin between the navel and knee is strictly prohibited.
  - Engaging in any sexual activity that stimulates the wife's vagina is forbidden, including conjugal relations and other forms of stimulation, such as masturbation.
- However, within these limits, the husband may:
  - Rest his head on the wife's clothed lap.
  - Kiss any other part of the wife's body, including mouth-to-mouth kissing.
  - Engage in physical contact like fondling breasts.
  - Have non-penetrative physical contact with any of his body parts while ensuring no vaginal stimulation occurs.
- Husband and wife will continue to interact with each other in day-to-day matters such as eating together, sleeping in the same bed etc.
- Divorce during this time is impermissible, but if issued, it will be valid and carry its full implications.
