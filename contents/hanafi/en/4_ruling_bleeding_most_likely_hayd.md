# Ruling: Bleeding Most Likely Hayd

## Guidance

- Your latest recorded discharges may soon qualify as Hayd, although they haven't yet surpassed the 72-hour threshold.
- Everytime the bleeding discontinues such that you are not sure if it will come back later or if it has completely stopped, it's Wajib (mandatory/necessary) to complete your Salaah (prayer) at the latest permissible times:
  - For Fajr and Dhuhur: Pray at the last possible moment.
  - For ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Isha: Pray before Makrooh (disliked) time, defined as:
    - ‘Asr: About 20 minutes before sunset when the sun turns pale yellow.
    - Maghrib: When many stars are visible, but with Western horizon still red.
    - ‘Isha: At the midpoint between Maghrib and Fajr.
- Once the minimum quota for Hayd has been met, then all the Ahkaam related to Hayd will apply. Ensure to make a proper record once your bleeding has exceeded 72 hours.
- If bleeding stops for more than 15 days, and is shorter than 3 days, it's considered Istihaadah, requiring Qadaa (makeup) of missed Salaah (prayer) during these days you were advised not to pray by us.

## Additional Clarifications

- Delaying Salaah (prayer) is advised due to the potential recurrence of bleeding, making it Waajib (mandatory/necessary) to adhere to this guidance.
- You are not yet required to do Ghusl each time your bleeding stops. You may suffice on Wudu (partial ablution) for each Salaah (prayer)
- If bleeding resumes and meets the Hayd criterion of at least bridging 72 hours(spotting or otherwise), actions taken during this period may need review:
  - Repeat any Qadaa Salaah (prayer) and Fasting performed during this time (when possible to do so).
  - Remake any Ramadan fasting observed during this period.
  - Fard Salaah (prayer) performed, though nullified, won't require repetition.
- Despite the possibility of bleeding not lasting over 72 hours, current evidence suggests it's likely to become Hayd. Practice based on this assumption.
- If future information reclassifies the bleeding as Istihaadah, you'll be obligated (Waajib) to makeup for missed worship.
- However, there's no sin in missing worship when acting on the best available evidence.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- If bleeding begins during daytime fasting, it's Waajib (mandatory/necessary) to break your fast discreetly and do Qadaa (makeup) for it later.
- Bleeding that starts and persists overnight until Fajr exempts you from fasting that day, but you must do Qadaa (makeup) for it subsequently.
- Should bleeding stop during the day, continue to observe fast-like behavior (abstaining from food, drink, and conjugal relations), though making up the fast later is still required.
- If bleeding ceases at night, leaving enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreema before Fajr, fast the oncoming day. If not, behave as fasting but do Qadaa (makeup) for it later.

## Marital Clarifications

- During this period, specific physical boundaries are set for the husband:
  - Direct contact with or viewing the wife's skin between the navel and knee is strictly prohibited.
  - Engaging in any sexual activity that stimulates the wife's vagina is forbidden, including conjugal relations and other forms of stimulation, such as masturbation.
- However, within these limits, the husband may:
  - Rest his head on the wife's clothed lap.
  - Kiss any other part of the wife's body, including mouth-to-mouth kissing.
  - Engage in physical contact like fondling breasts.
  - Have non-penetrative physical contact with any of his body parts while ensuring no vaginal stimulation occurs.
- Husband and wife will continue to interact with each other in day-to-day matters such as eating together, sleeping in the same bed etc.
- Divorce during this time is impermissible, but if issued, it will be valid and carry its full implications.
