# Ruling: Bleeding Most Likely Hayd

## Guidance

- Stop praying Salaah, fasting, Tilawah, Tawaaf etc.
- When bleeding stops and it's unclear if it will resume, it's Wajib to complete your Salaah at the latest permissible times:
  - Fajr and Dhuhr: Pray at the last possible moment.
  - ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Isha: Pray before Makrooh time, defined as:
    - ‘Asr: About 20 minutes before sunset (when the sun turns pale yellow).
    - Maghrib: When many stars are visible, but with Western horizon still red.
    - ‘Isha: At the midpoint between Maghrib and Fajr for men able to attend Salaah in congregation. For women, this does not apply so they will complete ‘Isha at the last possible moment.
- Ghusl is not required every time bleeding stops; Wudu is enough for Salaah.

## Additional Clarifications

- Hayd materializes when there's
  - at least 72 hours of bleeding(spotting or otherwise)
  - less than 15 days apart
- Currently, your cycle hasn't met these criteria yet, so we must assume that this bleeding is Most Likely Hayd
- Eventually, depending on how the future unfolds, Bleeding Most Likely Hayd will evolve into one of two possibilities:
  - Hayd, because the bleeding reached 72 hours. In this case:
    - If any Qadaa Salaah and/or fasting was done during the days of Hayd, then these need to be repeated.
    - Fard Salaah during the time of Hayd is exempt and is not subject to Qadaa
  - Istihadah, because the bleeding didn't end up reaching 72 hours. In this case:
    - Any Fard worship missed (even though on account of our guidance provided) is subject to Qadaa
    - Note: There is no sin for missing as you acted on the best available evidence

## Ramadan Clarifications

- Missing a Ramadan fast on account of a Bleeding Most Likely Hayd can take on the following scenarios:
  - If the bleeding started during daytime fasting, then it is Wajib to break your fast discreetly
  - If the bleeding started during nighttime and persists overnight until Fajr, then you are exempted from fasting that day
    - However, if the bleeding stopped at night before Fajr time sets in, such that there was enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreemah before Fajr to be done, then it is required to fast that day.
  - If the bleeding stopped during daytime, then you must continue to observe fast-like behaviour (abstain from food, drink, and conjugal relations)
- Any Ramadan fast that was missed, whether on account of a legitimate excuse (such as the above scenarios) or not is subject to Qadaa
  - If Qadaa is not possible on account of valid excuses, then Fidyah must be given in lieu of each missed fast. Kindly reach out to scholars for specific guidance

## Marital Clarifications

- During this period, specific physical boundaries are set for the husband:
  - Direct contact with or viewing the wife's skin between the navel and knee is strictly prohibited.
  - Engaging in any sexual activity that stimulates the wife's vagina is forbidden, including conjugal relations and other forms of stimulation, such as masturbation.
- However, within these limits, the husband may:
  - Rest his head on the wife's clothed lap.
  - Kiss any other part of the wife's body, including mouth-to-mouth kissing.
  - Engage in physical contact like fondling breasts.
  - Have non-penetrative physical contact with any of his body parts while ensuring no vaginal stimulation occurs.
- Husband and wife will continue to interact with each other in day-to-day matters such as eating together, sleeping in the same bed etc.
- Divorce during this time is impermissible, but if issued, it will be valid and carry its full implications.
