# Ruling: Tuhr

## Guidance

- These are the days in which you are able to attain ritual purity (through Wudu / Ghusl) that enables you to perform your religious observances (Fard, Wajib, Sunnah and Nafl), such as:
  - Salaah
  - Fasting
  - Tilawah of Quran
  - Tawaaf

## Additional Clarifications

- Tuhr are those days in which a woman is not undergoing Hayd or Nifaas
- She is to observe all seasonal/daily religious observances during this time.

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relationships are permissible
- Divorce during this time is permissible, provided no conjugal relationships have taken place in this period
- If conjugal relationships have taken place, then divorce will be Makrooh. However, it will still be valid and carry its full implications.
