# Ruling: Bleeding Most Likely Istihadah

## Guidance

- Bleeding in this period is likely not Hayd and should be treated according to the ruling of Istihadah, as such:
  - Ignore all bleeding (regardless of its volume/color) and continue your regular worship practices:
    - Five daily Salaah.
    - Fasting during Ramadan.
    - Tilawah of Quran.
- Renew Wudu whenever bleeding/spotting occurs. If this happens during Salaah, then Salaah breaks and must be restarted.
- If bleeding frequency prevents completion of Salaah, follow the guidelines for Ma’dhur as detailed in this link: <https://mensesmatters.org/rulings-for-the-excused-madhur>

## Additional Clarifications

- Based on all the evidence available, this bleeding is currently classified as Istihadah:
  - Treat it like a nosebleed. It breaks Wudu but doesn’t exempt you from Fard / Wajib worship.
  - Any Nafl and Sunnah Salaah / Fasting performed, when it was nullified after commencing it in a state of Tuhr is subject to Qadaa.
- Bleeding Most Likely Istihadah can eventually evolve into Hayd, and thus exempt and invalidate the worship performed accordingly. If that happens, then keep in mind:
  - If any Qadaa Salaah was performed during these days, then they are to be repeated.
  - Fard Salaah, though nullified, need not be repeated.
  - Any fasting performed will be nullified. As such you are to repeat Ramadan fasts and Qadaa fasts.
  - Any Nafl and Sunnah Salaah / Fasting performed, when it was nullified after commencing it in a state of Hayd is NOT subject to Qadaa. If they were commenced in a state of Tuhr and then Hayd nullified them, then they are subject to Qadaa
- Tilawah of Quran is not subject to Qadaa

## Marital Clarifications
