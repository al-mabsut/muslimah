# Ruling: Bleeding Most Likely Istihadah

## Guidance

- Bleeding in this period is likely not Hayd and should be treated under the ruling of Istihadah, as such:
  - You are to disregard any bleeding (regardless of its volume/color) and continue your regular worship practices:
    - Five daily Salaah.
    - Fasting during Ramadan.
    - Reciting Quran.
    - Performing Tawaaf in Hajj / Umrah.
- Renew Wudu whenever bleeding/spotting occurs. If this happens during Salaah, the prayer breaks and must be restarted.
- If bleeding frequency prevents completion of Salaah, follow the guidelines for Maâ€™dhur as detailed in this link: <https://mensesmatters.org/rulings-for-the-excused-madhur>

## Additional Clarifications

- Though currently classified as Istihadah, future developments might reclassify it as Hayd, affecting worship practices. When this happens, then for all the days marked as Hayd:
  - Repeat any Qadaa Salaah performed.
  - Fard Salaah, though nullified, need not be repeated.
  - Any fasting performed will be nullified. As such you are to repeat Ramadan fasts and any Qadaa fasts.
  - Any optional and Sunnah Salaah / Fasting performed, when it was nullified after commencing it in a state of Tuhr is to be made Qadaa of. If they were commenced not in a state of Tuhr then any such optional / Sunnah worship does not require Qadaa.
- There is no Qadaa for Tilawah of Quran.

## Marital Clarifications

- One ought to abstain from conjugal relationships during this time. For more information, kindly follow this link: <https://mensesmatters.org/intercourse-during-early-blood/>
