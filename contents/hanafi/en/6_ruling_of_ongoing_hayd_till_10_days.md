# Ruling: Ongoing Hayd

## Guidance

- When unsure if bleeding has fully ceased or will resume, it's Mustahabb to complete your Salaah at the latest permissible times:
  - For Fajr and Dhuhur: Pray at the last possible moment.
  - For ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Isha: Pray before Makrooh time, defined as:
    - ‘Asr: About 20 minutes before sunset when the sun turns pale yellow.
    - Maghrib: When many stars are visible, but with Western horizon still red.
    - ‘Isha: At the midpoint between Maghrib and Fajr.
- Each time your bleeding stops, before engaging in any act of worship such as prayer, Quran, fasting etc. you are required to do Ghusl (full ablution)

## Ramadan Clarifications

- If bleeding begins during daytime fasting, it's Wajib to break your fast discreetly and do Qadaa for it later.
- Bleeding that starts and persists overnight until Fajr exempts you from fasting that day, but you must do Qadaa for it subsequently.
- Should bleeding stop during the day, continue to observe fast-like behavior (abstaining from food, drink, and conjugal relations), though making up the fast later is still required.
- If bleeding ceases at night, leaving enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreema before Fajr, fast the oncoming day. If not, behave as fasting but do Qadaa for it later.

## Marital Clarifications

- During this period, specific physical boundaries are set for the husband:
  - Direct contact with or viewing the wife's skin between the navel and knee is strictly prohibited.
  - Engaging in any sexual activity that stimulates the wife's vagina is forbidden, including conjugal relations and other forms of stimulation, such as masturbation.
- However, within these limits, the husband may:
  - Rest his head on the wife's clothed lap.
  - Kiss any other part of the wife's body, including mouth-to-mouth kissing.
  - Engage in physical contact like fondling breasts.
  - Have non-penetrative physical contact with any of his body parts while ensuring no vaginal stimulation occurs.
- Husband and wife will continue to interact with each other in day-to-day matters such as eating together, sleeping in the same bed etc.
- Whenever the bleeding has ended, then conjugal relationships are allowed provided the wife has taken Ghusl
- Divorce during this time is impermissible, but if issued, it will be valid and carry its full implications.
