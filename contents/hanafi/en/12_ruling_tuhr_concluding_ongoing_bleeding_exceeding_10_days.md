# Ruling: Tuhr

## Guidance

- Your Hayd lasted till your latest Hayd habit:
  - In the case you took a precautionary Ghusl (full ablution) at the conclusion of your Hayd habit, as advised previously, then none of the worhsip you performed since then has been compromised.
  - If not, then there may be at least one Salaah (prayer) that needs to be made Qadaa (makeup) of. Kindly refer to a scholar for more guidance.
- Any Qadaa (makeup) Salaah (prayer) performed until your Hayd habit will be invalid and will need to be repeated.
- Any Salaah (prayer) that was not performed between Hayd habit day and the 10th day of your Ongoing Bleeding will need to be made Qadaa (makeup) of

- Accordingly, your habit was applied and the previous guidance you received has changed accordingly.
