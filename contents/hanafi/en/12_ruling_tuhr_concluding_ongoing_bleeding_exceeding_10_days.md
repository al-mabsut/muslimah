# Ruling: Tuhr

## Guidance

- Based on the latest inputs you provided, your Ongoing Hayd exceeded 10 days, on account of which we needed to apply your Habit.
- Accordingly, Hayd and Tuhr have been retroactively applied and you need to account for the fact that:
  - Any worship performed during the days now marked as Hayd is invalidated
  - Any Wajib Ghusl performed during the days now marked as Hayd is invalidated
  - Any day that has changed from Ongoing Hayd to Tuhr is subject to Qadaa for Salaah
- If you were previously advised about doing a precautionary Ghusl but you did not do that, then all worship done from the point that Hayd has officially ended until the next time you did Ghusl is invalidated and will need to be repeated.

## Additional Clarifications

- Matters have consolidated as your Ongoing Bleeding exceeded 10 days
- Accordingly, your habit was applied and the previous guidance you received has changed accordingly.
- If you would like to keep track of your habit for future reference, then look at the number of days of Hayd that were marked off for your current cycle as well as the number of days of Tuhr preceding your last Hayd.
- Ensure to consult a scholar about the precautionary Ghusl if this is a source of confusion to you.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- Take note of all the days subject to Qadaa as detailed under "Guidance"

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relationships are permissible
