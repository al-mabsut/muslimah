# Ruling: Tuhr

## Guidance

- Your Hayd lasted till your latest Hayd habit:
  - In the case you took a precautionary Ghusl at the conclusion of your Hayd habit, as advised previously, then none of the worhsip you performed since then has been compromised.
  - If not, then each Salaah since your Hayd habit will be invalidated until a time where you did Ghusl
- Any Qadaa Salaah performed until your Hayd habit will be invalid and will need to be repeated.
- Any Salaah that was not performed between Hayd habit day and the 10th day of your Ongoing Bleeding will need to be made Qadaa of

## Additional Clarifications

- Matters have consolidated as your Ongoing Bleeding exceeded 10 days
- The meaning of Hayd habit is the latest valid duration of Hayd as recorded, that we revert to in this case.
- Accordingly, your habit was applied and the previous guidance you received has changed accordingly.
- Kindly consult a scholar about the precautionary Ghusl if this is a source of confusion to you.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- On account of reverting back to your latest habit:
  - Any Qadaa fasting performed until your Hayd habit will be invalid and will need to be repeated.
  - Any fasting that was not performed between Hayd habit day and the 10th day of your Ongoing Bleeding will need to be made Qadaa of

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relationships are permissible
