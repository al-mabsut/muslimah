# Ruling: Istihadah

## Guidance

- When a bleeding is observed outside the days of Hayd / Nifaas, then such a bleeding is termed Istihadah
- From a religious perspective, this bleeding is to be regarded on the same level as a nose bleeding:
  - Despite this bleeding, you are still required to observe your daily prayers and fasting
  - If this bleeding is continuous, then you are to wait with praying until the bleeding subsides.
    - However, if the time of Salaah is about to expire, then one should do a Wudu and pray as normal.
  - If the bleeding continuous such that it encompasses an entire Salaah time, from beginning till the end such that in between there is not sufficient time to do Wudu and complete a prayer, then the ruling of Ma’dhur will apply to you as detailed in this link: https://mensesmatters.org/rulings-for-the-excused-madhur

## Additional Clarifications

- This type of bleeding can be deceiving, where physically speaking the flow can be very heavy and have all the signs of Hayd / Nifaas. However, since this bleeding occurs outside the days that Shari’iyyah regards as Hayd, this bleeding is to be ignored.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- This bleeding has no religious implications on fasting

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relationships are permissible, despite the bleeding
