# Ruling: Istihadah

## Guidance

- Bleeding outside the days of Hayd or Nifaas is termed Istihadah.
- Treat this bleeding like a nosebleed:
  - Continue your daily prayers and fasting.
  - If bleeding is continuous, wait until it subsides to pray.
  - If prayer time is about to expire, perform Wudu and pray as normal.
  - If bleeding continues throughout an entire prayer time, making it impossible to complete Wudu and prayer, refer to the Maâ€™dhur ruling: https://mensesmatters.org/rulings-for-the-excused-madhur

## Additional Clarifications

- This bleeding might seem heavy like Hayd or Nifaas, but since it occurs outside the recognized days, it should be ignored.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- This bleeding has no religious implications on fasting

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relationships are permissible, despite the bleeding
