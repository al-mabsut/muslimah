# Ruling: Most Likely Tuhr

## Guidance

- Based on the latest information provided by you, your Ongoing Hayd concluded before your latest Hayd habit.
- Accordingly, on it's conclusion you were to perform a Ghusl to attain purity from the state of Hayd and resume your seasonal/daily worship as applies (Prayer and Ramadan etc.)
- If the conclusion of Hayd was just before a Salaah time while there was sufficient time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreema remaining, perform Qadaa for the missed Salaah. If not, Qadaa is not required.

## Additional Clarifications

- Since your Hayd ended earlier than usual; there is always a chance that your Hayd could still return. A precautionary Ghusl at your Hayd habit time is advisable due to the possibility of bleeding resuming within 15 days (from the conclusion of Hayd).
- Such resuming of bleeding may end up compromising your Salaah until you have repeated your Ghusl again. The precautionary Ghusl is therefore adviced to avoid this from happening.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- If your Hayd ended during the day, then you are required to behave like a fasting person for the remainder of the day by abstaining from food, drinks and conjugal relationships.
- If your Hayd ended during the night, such that there was enough time before Fajr for you to complete a Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreema, then accordingly you will be required to fast that day. If no such time sufficient was remaining, then you will be considered as someone whose Hayd ended during the day and accordingly you will be required to behave like a fasting person and later on make Qadaa of that day.

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relationships are not yet allowed, until the Hayd habit has been reached
- Until such time, specific physical boundaries are set for the husband:
  - Direct contact with or viewing the wife's skin between the navel and knee is strictly prohibited.
  - Engaging in any sexual activity that stimulates the wife's vagina is forbidden, including conjugal relations and other forms of stimulation, such as masturbation.
- However, within these limits, the husband may:
  - Rest his head on the wife's clothed lap.
  - Kiss any other part of the wife's body, including mouth-to-mouth kissing.
  - Engage in physical contact like fondling breasts.
  - Have non-penetrative physical contact with any of his body parts while ensuring no vaginal stimulation occurs.
- Husband and wife will continue to interact with each other in day-to-day matters such as eating together, sleeping in the same bed etc.
- Conjugal relationships will remain impermissible even if the bleeding has fully stopped. (because this is still the time before the Hayd habit.)
- Divorce during this time is impermissible, but if issued, it will be valid and carry its full implications.
- Once the Hayd habit has been reached and the bleeding has not returned, then conjugal relationships are allowed again.
