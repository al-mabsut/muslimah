# Ruling: Most Likely Tuhr

## Guidance

- Your Ongoing Hayd has ended earlier than your previous cycle.
  - Note the exact duration of your previous Hayd (for instance, 7 days and 3 hours).
  - Note that your current Hayd is shorter (for instance, 4 days and 3 hours).
  - Calculate the difference between the two durations (e.g., 3 days). This is your "Cautionary Period"
- For the beginning and ending of this period, be mindful of two types of Ghusl, respectively:
  - Wajib Ghusl: Perform Ghusl when bleeding stops before any worship.
    - If there's enough time to complete Ghusl and Salaah, do not miss the Salaah; if missed, then it is subject to Qadaa.
    - If there's no time for Ghusl before Salaah time ends, you are exempt from praying that Salaah.
    - If there's time for Ghusl but not for Takbeer-e-Tahreemah, you are exempt from praying that Salaah.
    - If there's just enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreemah, then â€˜Isha must be performed; if missed, then it is subject to Qadaa.
  - Mustahabb Ghusl: Perform a precautionary Ghusl at the end of the "Cautionary Period"

## Additional Clarifications

- Tuhr is confirmed when:
  - 15 days (360 hours) pass without bleeding that qualifies as Hayd.
- So far, your cycle hasn't met these criteria yet.
- "Cautionary Period" as referred to under "Guidance" is termed as cautionary to bring to your attention that depending on how the future unfolds, some/all the days within this period can still become Hayd.
- Ghusl is Wajib whenever your Ongoing Hayd ends to maintain purity for worship.
- If bleeding resumes within 15 days, it invalidates your Ghusl, requiring it to be redone. Otherwise, your worship will not be valid.
- A precautionary follow-up Ghusl helps maintain purity if bleeding resumes after the "Cautionary Period"
- Ensure to consult a scholar about the precautionary Ghusl if this is a source of confusion to you.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- If Ongoing Hayd ends during the day, behave like a fasting person (abstain from food, drinks, and conjugal relationships).
- If Ongoing Hayd ends at night, as long as there is enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreemah before Fajr, then fasting that day is Fard and must be performed; if missed, then it is subject to Qadaa.
  - If no such time sufficient was remaining, then you will be considered as someone whose Hayd ended during the day and accordingly you will be required to behave like a fasting person for the remainder of the day. That day will be subject to Qadaa.

## Marital Clarifications

- During the "Cautionary Period", conjugal relationships will remain impermissible despite the bleeding having fully stopped.
- Until such time, specific physical boundaries are set for the husband:
  - Direct contact with or viewing the wife's skin between the navel and knee is strictly prohibited.
  - Engaging in any sexual activity that stimulates the wife's vagina is forbidden, including conjugal relations and other forms of stimulation, such as masturbation.
- However, within these limits, the husband may:
  - Rest his head on the wife's clothed lap.
  - Kiss any other part of the wife's body, including mouth-to-mouth kissing.
  - Engage in physical contact like fondling breasts.
  - Have non-penetrative physical contact with any of his body parts while ensuring no vaginal stimulation occurs.
- Husband and wife will continue to interact with each other in day-to-day matters such as eating together, sleeping in the same bed etc.
- Divorce during this time is impermissible, but if issued, it will be valid and carry its full implications.
