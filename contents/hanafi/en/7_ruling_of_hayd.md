# Ruling: Hayd

## Guidance

- Fard (obligatory) prayers performed during this period are nullified and do not require makeup (Qadaa).
- Qadaa (makeup) prayers completed during this time are nullified and must be repeated.

## Additional Clarifications

- The ruling of `Hayd` is different from the ruling of `Bleeding Most Likely Hayd` in the sense that for `Hayd` a sufficient amount of history is available to be 100% decisive in extending this ruling. `Bleeding Most Likely Hayd` on the other hand is too recent and has still potential for changing depending on how your subsequent days evolve.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- Fasting during these days is nullified and must be made Qadaa of (makeup) later.

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relations are strictly forbidden during this period.
- Divorces initiated by the husband, though prohibited, will still be effective with all associated consequences.
