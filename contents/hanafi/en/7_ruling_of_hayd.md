# Ruling: Hayd

## Guidance

- Fard prayers performed during this period are nullified and are not subject to Qadaa.
- If Qadaa prayers were completed during this time, then they are nullified and must be repeated.

## Additional Clarifications

- In total there are three different terminologies we use:
  - Hayd: This is a historic, religious fact. It cannot undergo any change despite what may happen in the future.
  - Bleeding Most Likely Hayd: This is a bleeding episode happening in your current cycle, and so far is less than 72 hours. Either it will evolve to Ongoing Hayd, or either it will evolve to Istihadah.
  - Ongoing Hayd: This is a bleeding episode happening in your current cycle, lasting 72 hours or more. Either it will evolve to Hayd, or either it will evolve to a portion being Hayd and a portion being Istihadah.
- It is important to be vigilant of how Bleeding Most Likely Hayd and Ongoing Hayd evolve, so that you know exactly what days are subject to Qadaa for your worship.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- All types of fasting(including Nafl) during these days are nullified:
  - Fard and Waajib fasting are subject to Qadaa
  - Sunnah and Nafl fasting are subject to Qadaa provided they were started before Hayd started during the day.

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relations are strictly forbidden during this period.
- Divorces initiated by the husband, though prohibited, will still be effective with all associated consequences.
