# Ruling: Most Likely Tuhr

## Guidance

- Based on the latest information provided by you, your Ongoing Hayd ended after your latest Hayd habit and did not exceed 10 days.
- Perform Ghusl to attain purity and resume your regular worship (prayer, fasting, etc.).
- If Hayd ended just before a prayer time with enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreemah, then such a Salaah is Fard. If missed, then it is subject to Qadaa; otherwise not.
- Keep track of your Tuhr until 15 days pass since the end of your Hayd, as the ruling can change.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- If Hayd ended during the day, act like a fasting person for the rest of the day (abstain from food, drinks, and conjugal relationships).
- If Hayd ended before Fajr with enough time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreemah, then fasting for that day is required. If missed, then it is subject to Qadaa.
  - If no such time sufficient was remaining, then you will be considered as someone whose Hayd ended during the day and accordingly you will be required to behave like a fasting person for the remainder of the day. That day will be subject to Qadaa.

## Marital Clarifications

- Conjugal relationships are allowed as long as bleeding has not resumed.
