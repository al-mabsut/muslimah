# Ruling: Most Likely Tuhr

## Guidance

- Based on the latest information provided by you, your Ongoing Hayd concluded after your latest Hayd habit and did not exceed 10 days.
- Accordingly, on it's conclusion you were to perform a Ghusl to attain purity from the state of Hayd and resume your seasonal/daily worship as applies (Prayer and Ramadan etc.)
- If the conclusion of Hayd was just before a Salaah time while there was sufficient time for Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreema remaining, perform Qadaa for the missed Salaah. If not, Qadaa is not required.
- Until a Tuhr of 15 days since the conclusion of your Hayd has not occurred, the ruling could slightly change, ensure to keep track of this.

## Ramadan Clarifications

- If your Hayd ended during the day, then you are required to behave like a fasting person for the remainder of the day by abstaining from food, drinks and conjugal relationships.
- If your Hayd ended during the night, such that there was enough time before Fajr for you to complete a Ghusl and Takbeer-e-Tahreema, then accordingly you will be required to fast that day. If no such time sufficient was remaining, then you will be considered as someone whose Hayd ended during the day and accordingly you will be required to behave like a fasting person and later on make Qadaa of that day.

## Marital Clarifications

- As long bleeding has not returned at any point in time, then conjugal relationships are allowed again.
