  "guidance": [
    "Bleeding in this period is likely not Hayd and should be treated according to the ruling of Istihadah, as such:",
    "in:Ignore all bleeding (regardless of its volume/color) and continue your regular worship practices:",
    "in:in:Five daily Salaah.",
    "in:in:Fasting during Ramadan.",
    "in:in:Tilawah of Quran.",
    "Renew Wudu whenever bleeding/spotting occurs. If this happens during Salaah, then Salaah breaks and must be restarted.",
    "If bleeding frequency prevents completion of Salaah, follow the guidelines for Ma’dhur as detailed in this link: https://mensesmatters.org/rulings-for-the-excused-madhur"
  ],
  "additionalClarifications": [
    "Based on all the evidence available, this bleeding is currently classified as Istihadah:",
    "in:Treat it like a nosebleed. It breaks Wudu but doesn’t exempt you from Fard / Wajib worship.",
    "in:Any Nafl and Sunnah Salaah / Fasting performed, when it was nullified after commencing it in a state of Tuhr is subject to Qadaa.",
    "Bleeding Most Likely Istihadah can eventually evolve into Hayd, and thus exempt and invalidate the worship performed accordingly. If that happens, then keep in mind:",
    "in:If any Qadaa Salaah was performed during these days, then they are to be repeated.",
    "in:Fard Salaah, though nullified, need not be repeated.",
    "in:Any fasting performed will be nullified. As such you are to repeat Ramadan fasts and Qadaa fasts.",
    "in:Any Nafl and Sunnah Salaah / Fasting performed, when it was nullified after commencing it in a state of Hayd is NOT subject to Qadaa. If they were commenced in a state of Tuhr and then Hayd nullified them, then they are subject to Qadaa",
    "Tilawah of Quran is not subject to Qadaa"
